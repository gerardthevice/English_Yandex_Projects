**SQL**

*Task*: To analyze the SQL database of the service for reading books by subscription

Tools: python, pandas, sqlalchemy, SQL

The coronavirus took the world by surprise, changing the usual order of things. In their free time, residents of cities no longer go outside, do not visit cafes and shopping centers. But there is more time for books. Startups noticed this and rushed to create apps for those who like to read.

Our company decided to be on the wave and bought a large subscription-based book reading service.

*Conclusions*: Based on the results of the analysis, it is clear that users are willing to read fiction. At the same time, they actively leave reviews and  books. Perhaps it would be a good idea to increase the variety of books in this genre, since in the pandemic people increasingly want to escape from reality. It would also be possible to work on related genres, such as detective fiction and so on.
