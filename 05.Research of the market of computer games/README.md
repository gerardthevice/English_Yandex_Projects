**Research of the market of computer games**

*Task*: Using historical data on sales of computer games such as user and expert ratings, genres and platforms,  identify patterns that determine the success of the game

*Tools*: python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, datetime,scipy, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing

The online store "Stream" sells computer games all over the world. The following data on game sales is available: user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation). It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow us to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns. We have data before 2016. Let's imagine that it's December 2016, and we are planning a campaign for 2017. It is necessary to work out the principle of working with the data.

*Conclusions*: Based on the results of statistical analysis, the hypothesis was confirmed that the user rating of Xbox One and PC is the same, and that the user rating of the Action and Sports genres is different.

To forecast a potentially popular product and plan an advertising campaign, it is necessary to take into account in which regions which platforms are currently popular, as well as which genres the target audience prefers in a particular region.
