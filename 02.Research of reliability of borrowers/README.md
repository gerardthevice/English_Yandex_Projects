# **Research of reliability of bank borrowers**

*Task*: Based on the statistics on the solvency of clients, investigate whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of timely repayment of the loan 

*Tools*: python, pandas, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing

The customer is the credit department of a bank. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. The initial data of the bank is based on the statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model â€” a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

**Conclusions**: Children and marital status, as well as income and the purpose of the loan do not affect timely repayment of the loan.
