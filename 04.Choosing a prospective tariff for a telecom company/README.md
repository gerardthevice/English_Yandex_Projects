**Choosing a prospective tariff for a telecom company**

*Task*: Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze the behavior of the customers and find the optimal tariff

*Tools*: python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, stats, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing

At our disposal there is data of Megaline, a federal mobile operator. Customers are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money. It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. We have the data of 500 Megalyne users at our disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and conclude which tariff is better.

*Conclusions*: smart tariff users use the services proportionally less than ultra users; the revenue in Moscow and the regions does not differ. Thus, we can say that the ultra tariff is better.
